# TicTacToe
Project from JB Academy

About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

Description
Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what we’ve learned in the previous stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe that two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw, or one of the players wins).

The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.

Objectives
In this stage, you should write a program that:

Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
You need to output the final result at the end of the game.

Good luck!

#Example
The example below shows how your program should work.
Notice that after Enter the coordinates: comes the user input.

---------
|       |
|       |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
---------
|       |
|   X   |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
This cell is occupied! Choose another one!
Enter the coordinates: two two
You should enter numbers!
Enter the coordinates: 1 4
Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!
Enter the coordinates: 1 1
---------
| O     |
|   X   |
|       |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 3
---------
| O     |
|   X   |
|     X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 1
---------
| O     |
| O X   |
|     X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 1
---------
| O     |
| O X   |
| X   X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 3
---------
| O     |
| O X O |
| X   X |
---------
Enter the coordinates: 3 2
---------
| O     |
| O X O |
| X X X |
---------
X wins
